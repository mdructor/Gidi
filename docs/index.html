                <h1>Gidi</h1>
                <h4>A new way to play.</h4>
                <p>Turn all of those hard-earned hours of muscle memory you have built up on your gamepad into a new way to create.</p>
                <p>
                    Gidi maps your controller input into MIDI output, transforming your controller into a powerful digital instrument. Use Gidi with
                    any DAW(Ableton, FLStudio, Logic, etc) or any MIDI synth and be on your way to creating beautiful melodies and harmony without
                    ever having to touch a keyboard.
                </p>

                <h3>Plug in -> play</h1>
                <p>
                    Gidi detects and connects to any type of gamepad you have (PS4, Xbox, Steam, etc). It will also detect available MIDI ports to send output to,
                    allowing you to connect to any digital synth imaginable and a lifetime of creative endeavors.
                </p>
                <h4>Infinite possibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    Gidi gives your controller the full range of the keyboard and comes with pre-defined control mappings to help you get started with your new instrument.
                    Mappings are fully extendable and new intuitive control schemes for different styles of music are always on the horizon.
                </p>
                <h4>Get it while its fresh!</h4>
                <p>
                    Gidi is still young and is growing quick.  You can get access to the available beta builds on the download page.  We love to get your 
                    feature requests and bug reports. There are future plans for a less free pro version in the future including VST3 builds, dynamic control mapping,
                    and more!
